# CRUD_Wishlist

My pet project "Wishlist" operates on a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principle, allowing users to manage items in their wishlist. Users can view existing comments and leave their own feedback. The program connects to the database directly, without using PDO, which requires the implementation of SQL query validation.
